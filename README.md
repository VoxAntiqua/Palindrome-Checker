This implementation of a palindrome checker takes a non-empty string, converts it to a character array of lower-case characters, removes non alphanumeric characters, then checks if it is equal to its reverse.

This project was created as an exercise for FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification project, "Build a Palindrome Checker Project".
